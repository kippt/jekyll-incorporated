On June 2, 2013, our Kickstarter campaign for the Spark Core campaign closed. And then we really got to work.

One year later, we're a pretty different company. We've shipped more than 25,000 Spark Cores. We've grown from 4 employees to 12. Four companies have successfully launched products powered by Spark, and many more are in development. We have a manufacturing partner, distribution partners, logistics partners, and a handful of technology partners.

In many ways, we're growing up. We're starting to look like a real company. We have meetings and conference calls; we've got lawyers and a PR firm. This is all kind of a funny feeling, given that two years ago Spark was just me and a soldering iron. But it does lead to the question — what do we want to be when we grow up?

I'd like to share a page from my first pitch deck for Spark, created in February 2012. Here it is:

The big issue that I saw was that hardware manufacturers didn't have a technology partner to help make their products better. Without an OS, hardware is limited to its capabilities when the product is shipped. An operating system provides a way for people to build applications for the hardware, which gives us Microsoft Office on the PC, and Angry Birds on the smartphone.

This vision has remained pretty constant for our company, because we believe that connected devices and the Internet of Things is the next major frontier of technology, and in order for it to succeed, people need a great foundation upon which they can build amazing products. And that foundation needs to be:

- **Easy**. Because the point of what we're doing is to solve hard problems so that our customers don't have to.
- **Open**. Because if it's not open, we're just creating risk and anxiety for our customers.
- **Affordable**. Because if it's not, then this stuff won't ever catch on.

Yesterday [we announced](http://www.businessinsider.com/spark-raises-49-million-to-fuel-its-cloud-dreams-2014-7) a new initiative of sorts: Spark OS. A cloud-based operating system for connected products.

Outline of the rest of the article:

- Explain what an OS is in the context of IoT
- Announce that we've released the open source local cloud, the Spark server
- Close with an announcement of our funding
