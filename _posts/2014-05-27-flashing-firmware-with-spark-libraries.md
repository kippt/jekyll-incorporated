## BLOG POST

We are very excited to announce the beginnings a library system for the Spark ecosystem; inspired by [npm](https://npmjs.org), powered by GitHub, and fully integrated with the [Build IDE](https://www.spark.io/build).

Let's take a quick walkthrough of this feature to show you how to get started.

Sweet!  An array of really bright NeoPixel's beaming their blinding beauty without typing a single character of code in about a minute. Not too shabby.

We built this feature to make it easy to contribute useful code to the community and to build on the shoulders of giants, we can't wait to see what you'll do!

Get started by opening up the library drawer in the Spark build IDE. Please also checkout the [Library Documentation](http://docs.spark.io/start/#flash-apps-with-spark-build-using-libraries) and [community announcement](TODO).

Have fun and let us know what you think!
