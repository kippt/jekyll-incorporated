We are very excited to announce the beginnings a library system for the Spark ecosystem; inspired by [npm](https://npmjs.org), powered by GitHub, and fully integrated with the [Build IDE](https://www.spark.io/build).

Spark Libraries make it easy to contribute useful code to the community and to build on the shoulders of giants, we can't wait to see what you'll do!

Let's take a quick walkthrough of this feature to illustrate how to use a library.

Sweet!  An array of really bright NeoPixel's beaming their blinding beauty without typing a single character of code in about a minute. Not too shabby.

Get started by opening up the library drawer in the Spark build IDE:

Please also checkout the [Library Documentation](http://docs.spark.io/start/#flash-apps-with-spark-build-using-libraries) and [community announcement]().

Have fun and let us know what you think!
