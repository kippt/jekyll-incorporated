The Spark team will be at [Maker Faire Bay Area](http://makerfaire.com/) on May 17 and 18 and we won’t be alone. Since our beginning, collaboration has always been at the heart of what Spark does, and in truth it’s at the heart of the entire Maker movement. It’s also extraordinarily important in the “Internet of Things”, where product creators have to work together to enable interconnectivity that makes each product better.

This weekend we’re joining forces with [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/), the creators of one of the most exciting wearable products on the market, and we’ll be showcasing what the Internet of Things can look like when people collaborate.

We’re perhaps most excited about what this collaboration, and thus compatibility, means for creators using the Spark tech stack; it will now be easier to connect your projects, prototypes and products to a Pebble smartwatch.

Pebble has a talented and intelligent team and a wonderful developer program, and was born from the same Kickstarter world that we were. We’ve had a great time working with them and are excited to be able to share this vision of interconnectivity in San Mateo this weekend. Be sure to stop by our Pebble/Spark booth (#813), play with some very cool demos, and share your feedback with our team. Can’t wait to see you and hear what you’re working on yourself!
